# Caps Lock Fixer
Caps Lock delay fix for Ubuntu Budgie

If you are coming form Windows or MacOS, you may notice that there is delay when using Caps Lock to switch between uppercase and lowercase letters. This problem ,or bug, comes from default behaviour of old typewriters. The fix that has been pushed to xorg has not yet been applied so we have to relay on the tricks to get expected result.

For this fix to work, place the files in your /home directory and then add fixer.sh to your startup applications sh "/home/username/fixer.sh"
